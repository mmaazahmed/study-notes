Terminology:
- power set - a set of all possible subsets (combinations) of a set  fsS
Lecture 1 -  optimization problems :
- models are mathematical devices that help us understand what has and will happen
Optimization models:
- has:
  an opbjective function that is to be minimized or maximized
  a set of constaints that must be honoured

  Optimization problems:

  - knap sack problem:

    - continuous:
      - fill highest value in knapsack till depleted then proceeded with next highest value item.
      - example of greedy solution to a greedy problem that finds the global maxima

    - discrete:
      - objective function:

    - brute force solution with correctness is n!
    - knap sack and other opti problems are exponential:
      - no solution exists that provides an exact solution that is not exponential time complex.

    - solution? Heuristic based algorithms such as greedy algorithms
      - eg?
         while bag not full and item available:
            add `best item to back pack
        - best item is determined through a heuristic function
